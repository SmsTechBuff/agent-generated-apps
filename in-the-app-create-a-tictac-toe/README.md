# in-the-app-create-a-tictac-toe
The code has a few issues. The main issue is that the gradio library does not have a Grid attribute. Instead, it seems like the intention was to create a grid-like layout for the Tic Tac Toe game board. However, the current implementation does not achieve this. Additionally, there are some logical issues with the game's update function.
